# SDSS Explore Tool

[Sloan Digita Sky Servey](https://www.sdss.org) is an multi-spectral imaging and reshift survey conducted using a dedicated telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, USA[[1]]

They processed the imformation gathered and used it to create the most detailed thee-dimensional maps of the skies with information for more than *three million* celestial bodies. 

The Explore tool is a part of their effort to make this data accessible and palatable for educators, researchers and ametuers alike.    

_for more information, and even more tools, check out [SciServer](sciserver.org) (v2.0.0).

## Deployment

The Jupyter Notebook itself can be rendered in different static formats(HTML,LaTeX,PDF,reStructuredText, and slide-shows[[2]]) with Jupyter's '''_[nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert)_''' utility and/or a [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). [MyBinder.org](mybinder.org). These methods provide users with freedom to play around with the repo without having to go to ther trouble of installing and configuring the Jupyter Notebook.
